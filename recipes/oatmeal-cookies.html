    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These oatmeal cookies are perfectly flavoured and lightly spiced with 
        just a touch of cinnamon. They're soft, chewy, and easily customizable - 
        just add 1 cup raisins, nuts, or chocolate chips when you mix in the oats. 
        Keep them on hand for after-school snacking or make a batch for a holiday
        cookie exchange.

        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1&frac12; teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups quick cooking oats</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray with flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium 
            bowl until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat butter, 1 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with 
            an electric mixer until creamy, at least 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, 
            one at a time, then mix in vanilla. Gradually mix in dry ingredients 
            until well combined. Add oats and mix until thoroughly incorporated. 
            Cover the bowl and chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 
            two cookie sheets with floured cooking spray. Place water in a small bowl and 2
            tablespoons sugar in another small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on the prepared 
            cookie sheets. Dip a large fork in the water, then i nsugar, and use to flatten each 
            cookie, rewetting and resugaring as necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown around the edges and centers 
            are nearly set, 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Allow cookies 
            to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to 
            cool completely.
